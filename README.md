# AQI-prediction-for-pollution-control-in-Indian-Cities

# Problem Statement 
 The Air Quality Index (AQI) is a critical measure of air pollution and a direct indicator of environmental health. Poor air quality seriously affects public health, impacting respiratory and cardiovascular conditions and increasing hospital admissions. Given the high pollution levels in many Indian cities, predicting AQI can provide timely insights to citizens and policymakers, enabling proactive measures and fostering improved environmental practices. This project aims to predict AQ levels across various Indian cities based on key pollutant metrics, facilitating early warnings and aiding pollution control initiatives.

# Motivation 
The project, “AQI Prediction for Pollution Control in Indian Cities,” tackles the urgent problem of air pollution, which has a profound impact on both public health and the environment. By utilizing an existing dataset and advanced predictive models, the aim is to provide accurate and timely air quality forecasts. These predictions will empower people with early warnings to protect their health, help policymakers make smarter decisions, and support sustainable urban planning. With this proactive approach, we hope to reduce health risks, implement better pollution control strategies, and identify key sources of pollution. Ultimately, the project shifts the focus from reacting to pollution problems to preventing them, aligning with global goals for a healthier and more sustainable future. There is a certain belief that this work can make a real difference in creating cleaner, safer, and more livable cities for everyone.
